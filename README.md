# CursorChaserGame

The CursorChaserGame is a game where the AI opponent tries to catch your cursor, and you need to dodge all the various attacks for as long as you can. It's based on the flash game "Small Man Chases Your Cursor", and this is the 3DS version. It's also available for Windows and the browser.

## Getting Started

To play this game, you will need a Nintendo 3DS with a custom firmware, and the Homebrew Launcher. You can learn how install it on (https://3ds.hacks.guide/)

Once you have that, simply copy the "CursorChaserGame.3dsx" file from the "/build" directory into the "/3ds" folder on your SD card. The game should now appear in the Homebrew Launcher.

The game is played purely with the touchscreen and pressing any button will close the game.
